# PapersWithCode Latest (pwcode)

## Get Latest Updates from PapersWithCode

This module allows you to deploy your own local server that retrieves latest PapersWithCode papers. You can also use web server hosted by us on [Render](https://pwcode.onrender.com/latest). The information can be retrieved in the form of [JSON](https://pwcode.onrender.com/latest), [RSS](https://pwcode.onrender.com/rss) or [Atom](https://pwcode.onrender.com/atom) feeds. All formats consist of the same data and are updated at the same time.
